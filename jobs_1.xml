It&#8217;s a model developed in the IT world, where you emulate the functions of those complex pieces of hardware with software, and run that software on standard, off-the-shelf hardware. You can add capacity faster and push out upgrades at the speed of the Internet. That&#8217;s the model for our next-generation network, powered by technologies including software-defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV). By 2020, we plan to virtualize and control over 75 percent of our network using this new software-defined architecture to meet the growing demands of data and video-hungry users.

The candidate will help drive how the VNFs, including vendors and industry, should evolve going forward while partnering with the platform teams to ensure we evolve to meet VNF needs. The work will span technical deliverables as well as overall coordination. The candidate will partner closely with D2 Platform, VNF teams as well as procurement, CSO and other areas.Education and Experience: Candidate shall have a PhD in an approved field from an accredited university and a minimum of 4 years of relevant experience, or a Master's degree in an approved field from an accredited university and a minimum of 6 years of relevant experience, or a Bachelor's degree in an approved field from an accredited university and a minimum of 8 years of relevant experience What Makes You Stand Out: Demonstrated ability to lead technical efforts and expertize in two or more of the following areas, with familiarity with other technologies, is a must: Cloud application development, Cloud/Virtualization, SDN, IP networking, Cloud/Data Center Technologies including Networking, SW development (especially in the area of network and/or cloud functions). Proven ability to quickly learn new technologies, ability to grasp architecture and design level nuances, and be able to develop solutions across applications and platforms, including use cases, interdependencies and data models, common reference connections or other tools to drive clarity across teams. The candidate should demonstrate excellent communication skills especially with respect to defining/describing capabilities and solutions at architecture or design level that can be easily grasped by VNF and platform teams. Strong preference for candidates who are open to new technologies, ideas and concepts, are driven by challenges and opportunities, proactively stay current with recent technologies and industry trends.
